===============
This Project simulates the times taken by Emergency teams to respond to Emergency situations. All events are modelled as discrete Events.


## 2.Dependencies
=================
    1. [DesmoJ](http://desmoj.sourceforge.net/home.html "Desmo-J") for discrete event Simulation.  
    2. [OpenStreetMaps](www.openstreetmap.org "OSM") for city geodata.(I've used Trento initiallly)  
    3. JADE Agent Development Framework for modelling the Agents involved  
    4. [JMapViewer](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/JMapViewer "JMapViewer") for rendering the maps on the screen
